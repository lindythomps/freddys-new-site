                    <h3>The Proposal</h3>
                    <p>Found only 35 minutes from Waterton Lakes National Park, Freddy's on Main is the perfect backdrop to retreat to from the Rocky Mountain elements after getting your essential southern Alberta mountainscape wedding photos. Original brick and hardwood floors in every direction, flooded with natural daylight, and topped with an open-truss barnwood-style ceiling draped in the romance of string lights in the evening. Not to mention the unmatched pair of original arch windows crouning the entire moment! This venue offers romance and emotion only a space 115-years old can invoke.</p>

                    <p>We are just getting started. We made a no-conditions offer on this space pre-covid and took possession the day Alberta shut down. The second floor has been a florified attic for decades and it genuinely felt like it was waiting just for us. Our relationship has been as rocky as the mountains, but with the most rewarding peaks. If you'd like to meet Freddy's family, know more about the Fred behind Freddy's and the story these walls are telling ouside fo the wedding business, then just say I do!</p>
